# Tremor Ring

## Setup

Before starting to develop with the Arduino IDE, it is required that you install the following libraries:
 - Adafruit Si7021 Library
 - Adafruit ADXL345

These libraries are needed because this project will use both of the Adafruit Si7021 to measure the temperature and Adafruit ADXL345 to measure the acceleration.
