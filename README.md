# Tremor Ring

## Setup

Before starting to develop with the Arduino IDE, it is required that you install the following libraries:
 - Adafruit Si7021 Library
 - Adafruit ADXL345
 - Blynk

These libraries are needed because this project will use both of the Adafruit Si7021 to measure the temperature and Adafruit ADXL345 to measure the acceleration. The Blynk is used to integrate the microcontroller with a mobile app that uses Blynk.
